# Skinny Mac Menubar Memory Monitor

Mac Memory Monitor - for MenuBar apps - skinny in terms of implementation (a single bash script)

## Running it

Download the adjacent `smmmm` script and shove it in `/usr/bin/` (err, has downsides) or `/usr/local/bin` (Homebrew command to follow)

```
smmmm
```

Or run it from GitHub's raw server:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paul-hammat/skinny_mac_menubar_memory_monitoring/master/smmmm | bash -s
```

## MenuBar apps looked for

JetBrains Toolbox - downloads updates for Intellij, PyCharm, etc (seems like it is written in Java)
ZoomOpener - launches Zoom.us for video conf calls 
Wunderlst
Skype Helper

Avira Anti Virus
